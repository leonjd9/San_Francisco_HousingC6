The program imports housign data and returns interactive charts based unit square footage, rent, and geographical location. This application is design to perform visaul/geograshical analysis of a determined area. It is capable of returning dynamic charts and maping settings which facilitate the study of a real state price per square footage and gross rent of  multiple neighborhoods. The program is a great resource for developers, real state investors and the average consumer looking to buy or rent in the short and long term.
